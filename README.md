# IPL-Dataset-Analysis

This is a project based on the IPL (Indian Premier League), a very popular franchise cricket tournament held every year.
The data spans 12 seasons (2008-2019) and is given in the form of two .csv files, storing match-wise and delivery-wise data respectively. 
I attempted to do an extensive analysis of the data using EDA and feature engineering, and came up with some pretty interesting conclusions, like ranking the best teams, batsmen and bowlers overall in 12 seasons of IPL.

Please note that the ranking criteria and rating system used is just my personal opinion and not meant to undermine the reader's preferences.

Hope you like it :)
